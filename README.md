# Supply Chain - ABC Segmentation & Kraljic Matrix
Segmentation is the foundation of supply chain optimization, impacting inventory management, supplier relationships, marketing, and warehousing strategies. 
Businesses must classify products, suppliers, and customers based on volume, margin contribution, and risk levels to develop efficient inventory strategies, 
optimize supplier contracts, and maximize profitability.These are two key segmentations:
1.	**ABC Analysis** (Single & Multi-Criteria Segmentation for Products)
2.	**Kraljic Matrix** (Supplier Segmentation Based on Risk & Cost Impact)

## **ABC Segmentation**
A method for inventory classification based on value contribution:

- **A Items (High Value, Low Quantity)** – Tight control, frequent monitoring.
- **B Items (Moderate Value, Moderate Quantity)** – Periodic review, balanced stock control.
- **C Items (Low Value, High Quantity)** – Minimal control, bulk purchasing.

Helps optimize inventory management by prioritizing stock control efforts.

## **Kraljic Matrix**
A strategic procurement model categorizing items by **supply risk** and **profit impact**:

- **Leverage Items (Low Risk, High Impact)** – Cost-saving opportunities, competitive sourcing.
- **Strategic Items (High Risk, High Impact)** – Critical, limited suppliers, long-term partnerships.
- **Bottleneck Items (High Risk, Low Impact)** – Hard to source, operational risks.
- **Routine Items (Low Risk, Low Impact)** – Common, low-value, easy to manage.

Enhances supply chain resilience and procurement strategies.
