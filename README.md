# Supply Chain - ABC Segmentation & Kraljic Matrix

## **ABC Segmentation**
A method for inventory classification based on value contribution:

- **A Items (High Value, Low Quantity)** – Tight control, frequent monitoring.
- **B Items (Moderate Value, Moderate Quantity)** – Periodic review, balanced stock control.
- **C Items (Low Value, High Quantity)** – Minimal control, bulk purchasing.

Helps optimize inventory management by prioritizing stock control efforts.

## **Kraljic Matrix**
A strategic procurement model categorizing items by **supply risk** and **profit impact**:

- **Leverage Items (Low Risk, High Impact)** – Cost-saving opportunities, competitive sourcing.
- **Strategic Items (High Risk, High Impact)** – Critical, limited suppliers, long-term partnerships.
- **Bottleneck Items (High Risk, Low Impact)** – Hard to source, operational risks.
- **Routine Items (Low Risk, Low Impact)** – Common, low-value, easy to manage.

Enhances supply chain resilience and procurement strategies.
